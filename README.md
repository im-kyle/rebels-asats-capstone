<h5>Project Details</h5>

<h6>Product Description</h6>

<p>
This application serves to address the current frustrations of Airmen and Guardians involving the awards application/submission/approval process. The user interface we have created always for users, authenticated or not, to search for awards that they are eligible for based off of their own information. No more guessing games! Next, authenticated users will have to opportunity to select which awards they wish to apply for, and draft packages (FORM 1206s) for them. But that's not all! Users will have the ability to add mentors. The mentors are simply other users who the mentee selects. Mentors have the ability to review and comment on packages created by their mentees.
